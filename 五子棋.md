1、遍历二维数组评估（效率太低?）(11*11用递归是不是更快)

2、下棋，评估场面，博弈树+ab剪枝；



学长课：

1、估值函数和搜索算法

2、博弈树

​	最大最小值算法  深度优先搜索(搜到底，回到父节点，一层层回)

3、限制搜索深度、采用剪枝算法

4、www.wqbase.com

5、优化方法：减少分支+不必要考虑棋盘上的所有空位

​	启发算法：增加AB剪枝触发概率（可以从落子位置为中心向外搜索）

6、估值算法：VCF（连续冲刺活三）  依靠**冲四活三**胜利	假活三（x ooo x)		跳三(oo o)  大跳(oo  o)大跳活二（o  o）

做冲四活三（可加分，具有冲刺价值）

In recent years, university students have shown a tendency to avoid team collaboration, and problems have surfaced in team relationships. Several issues have become apparent, including low levels of trust in teams, a preference for working with familiar individuals rather than strangers, a reluctance to take on significant responsibilities, personal problems causing chain reactions, and conflicts between maintaining friendly team relationships and achieving higher work efficiency. Enhancing university students' willingness to engage in team cooperation and creating a harmonious team environment has become a pressing issue for the collective student body

**Fact:**

1. What is the current level of willingness among college students to engage in group collaboration?

2. How has the trend of college students' attitudes toward group collaboration evolved in recent years?

3. Are there specific demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, major) that correlate with reduced willingness for group collaboration?

   Definition:*

   4. How do college students define "group collaboration," and how does this definition influence their willingness to participate?
   5. What are the key elements or characteristics that students consider essential for successful group collaboration, and how do these factors affect their engagement?

**Cause-Effect:** 6. What factors contribute to the low levels of trust that college students have in team settings?

1. How does the preference for working with familiar individuals over strangers impact the effectiveness of group collaboration?
2. What role do personal problems and their potential chain reactions play in decreasing willingness for group collaboration among college students?

**Value:** 9. How do college students perceive the value of teamwork and collaboration in their academic and future professional lives?

1. What are the key values and beliefs that underlie college students' willingness or reluctance to assume major responsibilities within a team?
